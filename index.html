    <p>
    A <em>verifiable claim</em> is a qualification, achievement, quality, or piece of
    information about an <a>entity's</a> background such as a name, government ID,
    payment provider, home address, or university degree.
    Such a claim describes a quality or
    qualities, property or properties of an entity which establish its existence and uniqueness.
    The use cases outlined here are provided in order to make progress toward
    possible future standardization and interoperability of both low and
    high-stakes <a>claims</a> with the goals of storing, transmitting, and receiving
    digitally verifiable proof of attributes such as qualifications and achievements.
    The use cases in this document focus on concrete scenarios that the technology defined
    by the group should address.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    The Verifiable Claims Working Group at the W3C is developing
    standards for expressing and exchanging "<a>claims</a>" that have been verified by a
    third party and to make them easier and more secure on the Web.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
        This document does NOT attempt to define an architecture for
        the support of Verifiable Claims.  Instead it expresses the sorts
        of needs that real users have that could be addressed through support
        for some sort of self-sovereign claim environment.  It attempts to use
        terminology that is consistent with the other deliverables of the
        Verifiable Claims Working Group (you can see the relevant terms
        in Appendix A).
    </div>
    <section>
        <h3>Importance of this work</h3>

        <p>Entities (people, organizations, devices) need to make many kinds of claims as part of their
        everyday activities.
        As more and more of these important activities  move to the Internet, entities need
        to be able to transmit instantly <em>verifiable</em> claims (e.g., about their
        location, accomplishments, value, what-have-you). From educational records
        to payment account access, the next generation of web
        applications will authorize entities to perform actions based on
        rich sets of credentials issued by trusted parties.
        Human- and machine-mediated decisions about job applications, account access,
        collaboration, and professional development will depend on filtering and
        analyzing growing amounts of data.  It is essential that data be verifiable.
        </p>
        <p>Standardization of digital <a>claim</a> technologies makes it
        possible for many stakeholders to issue, earn, and trust these
        essential records about their counterparties, without being
        locked into proprietary platforms.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Use case model</h3>
        <p>This document presents an aggregate use case model, comprised of Needs, Roles, Tasks, and Sequences. Taken together, these models define the
        use cases that the Verifiable Claims Working Group will address.</p>

        <p>User needs define the problem space Verifiable Claims addresses. User Roles specify the roles different entities play when interacting
        with Verifiable Claims. Tasks define the functions users can accomplish and sequences demonstrate how tasks might be realized by
        interactions between entities over time.</p>
        <p>As with all models, this use case model is neither exhaustive nor complete. The listed uses cannot exhaustively capture all possible
        use cases. Similarly, the models do not completely characterize the use cases represented. However, the combined model provides
        specific, coherent guidance for the work ahead.</p>

    <h2>User roles</h2>
    <p>There are four roles supported by Verifiable Claims: Issuer, Inspector, Subject, and Holder.</p>
    <img height="400" alt='Verifiable Claim User Roles' style='display:block; margin:auto' src="user-roles.svg"/>
    <dl>
        <dt>Issuer</dt>
        <dd>The entity that creates a claim and associates it with a particular subject.</dd>
        <dt>Inspector</dt>
        <dd>The entity verifying a claim about a given subject.
        <dt>Subject</dt>
        <dd>The entity about whom a claim is issued.
        <dt>Holder</dt>
        <dd>The entity who controls a particular claim. Often the subject of the claim, but not always. For example, the subject of a claim
        might be a pet who has received a vaccination. The holder of that claim is likely the pet's owner, not the pet. A holder is typically
        the initiator of the transmission of a claim.</dd>

        <h3>Finance</h3>
        <p>The Finance domain includes banking, brokerage, insurance, and other industries where there is a
        high value placed on knowing exactly with whom you are dealing.</p>
        <dl class="left dl-horizontal">
            <dt><udef>F.1 Reuse know your customer</udef></dt>
            <dd>Jane is opening an account at MidBank in Finland.  As part of
            that process, the bank asks her to provide two from a variety of
            possible sources to confirm her identity - a so called &quot;Know Your
            Customer&quot; check.  She selects government-supplied
            <a>verifiable claims</a> that confirm she
            receives postal mail at a certain address and
            that she has a national ID card. Confirming these allows the bank to
            open her account and be confident in her identity when she conducts
            transactions.</dd>
            <dd>Now that the account is open, Jane is issued a digitally
            signed <a>credential</a> for her checking account at MidBank.
            This credential verifies that Jane has an account at MidBank and
            has access to her associated checking account. Since MidBank (and all
            banks in Finland) are required to perform
            &quot;Know Your Customer&quot; checks on accounts, this credential
            can also be used as sufficient verification by other financial
            institutions. This can help Jane assure destination banks that
            she is verified, thereby allaying concerns about misdirected
            transactions and money laundering.</dd>
            <dt><udef>F.2 Money transfer</udef></dt>
            <dd>Susan wants to send funds to her family in another country via a
            popular money transfer service.  She has <a>verifiable claims</a> in her
            <a>credential repository</a> that can be used to share her <a>identity profile</a>.
            She has also been
            sent a <a>claim</a> from her family verifying their banking information.
            By sharing these with the money transfer service, they can
            automatically verify the source and destination of funds, thus being
            confident in the delivery of those funds and satisfying various
            regulations regarding prevention of money laundering.</dd>
            <dt><udef>F.3 Closing account</udef></dt>
            <dd>John opens a checking account at Big Bank Co and is issued a Verifiable Claim
            indicating that the account exists, that the bank verified John's identity, and that
            John has access to the account.  Some time later, John is moving to a new city and
            decides to close that account.  Big Bank Co needs to revoke that claim as part of their
            normal account closing process.</dd>
            <dt><udef>F.4 Trying out a new service</udef></dt>
            <dd>Nikita has several accounts with BigBank, as well as a
            brokerage account with WallStreetCo.  She had placed all of her claims
            in a <a>credential repository</a> at BigBank that came free
            when she opened her accounts.  WallStreetCo is now offering a new
            <a>repository</a> that has an interface she thinks she will prefer.
            Nikita copies
            her claims from BigBank into the repository at WallStreetCo to
            experiment with their service, but continues to use the service
            from BigBank while she is testing.</dd>
            <dt><udef>F.5 New bank account from home</udef></dt>
            <dd>Alice wants to open a new bank account.
            BigOnlineBank offers the ability to do this from home if she can
            provide electronic credentials.  She offers government issued
            certificates that verify her identity (address, national identity
            number, etc.), and opens her new account from her couch.</dd>

        <p>The education domain includes all levels of the educational experience; from primary
        through professional continuing education.</p>
        <dl class="left dl-horizontal">
            <dt><udef>E.1 Digital transcript</udef></dt>
            <dd>Joleen is the registrar of Mega University and, by virtue of
            her office, is responsible for the integrity, accuracy, and
            security of academic records.  Joleen has been a pioneering
            registrar in advocating an 'extended transcript' that includes not
            only the standard set of course grades but also adds supplementary
            information on learner competencies.  These might include work
            experiences and non-educational but marketable skills. Upon the
            request of her students Joleen issues a digital credential that
            includes an extended transcript.</dd>
            <dt><udef>E.2 Taking a test</udef></dt>
            <dd>Eunice is about to take her ACT (a test used to evaluate her readiness for
            college).  When she arrives at the testing center, she is required to present
            identification.  Her government-issued identity certificate
            is acceptable, as the <a>verifiable claims</a>
            contained in it reflect all of the required attributes and it is impossible to counterfeit.</dd>
            <dt><udef>E.3 Transferring schools</udef></dt>
            <dd>Rocky is an undergraduate student at Wossamotta U.  His school
                provides a credential repository service to all students and alumni,
                so he chooses to use it.  In his third year, Rocky decides to
                transfer to Moosylvania Tech.  They do not offer a service, but
                he does not want to continue to use the service of his old (and
                now rival school) so he moves his claims to the
                service offered by his bank without needing to have them
                reissued.</dd>
            <dt><udef>E.4 Online classes</udef></dt>
            <dd>In MOOC and other on-line learning systems, being able
            to reliably identify participants is vital to ensure the
            individual evaluation and certification. Nick is participating in
            a course online and takes a test.
            He is required to provide his
            credentials to prove his identity before the test, and
            then to allow the system to issue a <a>verifiable claim</a> regarding the results of
            his test.</dd>

            <dt><udef>H.1 Prescribing</udef></dt>
            <dd>Barney is a physician, and has recently become board certified in his state.
            The state's board issues Barney a digital certificate confirming that he is certified
            to practice medicine in that state.  Barney can now use this certificate when writing
            prescriptions and referrals, thereby improving accountability and verifiability.</dd>
            <dt><udef>H.2 Online pharmacy</udef></dt>
            <dd>iPharmacy receives a prescription for Bob electronically from a local
            clinic.  It includes a certificate about the physician that issued
            the prescription as well as one about Bob.  iPharmacy's
            system automatically verifies the ability of the physician to
            write prescriptions, as well as Bob's insurance coverage.
            When Bob arrives to pick up his medication, iPharmacy
            further correlates his identity with the certificate, thereby
            improving the end-to-end accountability of their system.</dd>

            <dd>Tracy has a sore throat soon after moving to a new town.  She finds a physician through
            her health care network and goes in for treatment.  She is a new patient, so the
            clinic needs to know who she is and how she will be paying.  When checking in, she
            presents her verifiable claim that demonstrates her identity and her proof of
            insurance.  When the clinc submits this to the insurance company, they can
            automatically ascertain that she submitted her proof of identity and insurance to the provider
            and granted the physician the ability to submit the claim for payment.</dd>

            <dd>John is on the vacation of a lifetime, travelling the world.  Falling ill, he
            visits a health clinic in a country in which he does not live.
            At the clinic he is
            asked for proof of identity.  He provides a credential that
            verifies his name and address, but elects not to disclose his
            marital status nor his social security number, as those are
            neither requested nor required at this clinic. He further marks
            the disclosure as expiring in 30 days - he does not want his

            his governmental authority.  After satisfying background check requirements,
            the authority issues Tom an electronic version of his passport.  This
            version is verifiable and retains a history of all the places he visits so
            that immigration officials can quickly and easily evaluate his suitability as a
            visitor to their country.  Once they are satisfied, they will automatically add the

            reach an IFRC center just across the broder in a relatively
            safe area, but with no documentation.  Since the government of her homeland is in turmoil, there is no way for the IFRC staff
            to easilty establish their identities. Fortunately, Anoushka had been issued a self-soverign proof of birth, attached to which
            is the proof of birth and marriage for her parents.  She is able to retrieve this because it is available from many places on
            the Internet.  Since it is verifiable, the IFRC is comfortable vouching for them and resettling them in a safer area for the
            duration of the conflict.</dd>

    <h2>Focal Use Cases</h2>
    <p> Focal Use Cases are meant to provide examples where a blend of features from Verificable
    Claims standard may be used together to solve complex or challenging marketplace needs.</p>
    <section>
      <h2>Citizenship by parentage</h2>
      <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Sam wants to claim US citizenship because his mother is American. Sam has a digital birth 
          certificate from Kenya, where he was born while his Mother was in the Peace corps. He also 
          has a digital version of his mother's US passport. Because his mother’s name changed 
          between his birth and the issuance of the passport, Sam also has a marriage license with 
          her maiden and married names. Sam is applying for a new passport from the 
          US Secretary of State.</p>
      <h3>Distinction</h3>
        <p>This use case is challenging because the mother’s name changed, by marriage, between the 
          issuance of the birth certificate and passport.</p>
      <h3>Scenario</h3>
        <p>Sam’s mother emailed him the certificate, license, and passport as independent Verifiable 
          Credentials. He then creates a Verifiable Presentation which includes those credentials, 
          a statement of their relationship to each other and his relationship to his mother. He 
          then visits the U.S. Secretary of State website, creates an account, starts the 
          application for a passport, and uploads his new Verifiable Presentation as supporting 
          evidence. After processing the application, Sam is issued both a traditional passport 
          and a new digital passport.</p>
      <h3>Verifiable Credentials</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Birth Certificate</li>
          <li>Marriage License</li>
          <li>Mother’s Passport</li>
          <li>Sam’s Passport</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Verifiable Presentation</h3>
        <p>A Verifiable Presentation which includes those three credentials, adds his name, photo, 
          and demographic data along with the assertion that</p>
          <ol>
            <li>he is the child in the birth certificate</li>
            <li>mother in the birth certificate, the person in the passport, the spouse in the 
              marriage license are all the same person</li>
          </ol> 
      <h3>Trust Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>Sam is legally liable for his claim to the rights of citizenship. The state department is 
          on the hook for verifying the underlying credentials and Sam’s claims, including 
          correlating against any additional data they might already have.</p>
      <h3>Threat model</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Threat: Terrorist / Identity fraud.</strong> A bad actor could be 
            impersonating Sam to attain a passport. Of course, if a bad actor were to be able to 
            collect the required verifiable credentials--mother’s passport, birth certificate, and 
            marriage license, that actor has already significantly compromised the system. </li>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Response:</strong> Identity assurance based on the presentation and other 
                data, above and beyond what is in the presentation and the claims.</li>
              <li><strong>Response:</strong> Identity assurance based on the contents of the claims, 
                potentially with enhanced data embedded in the claims, i.e., data not currently in 
                passports, birth certificates, or marriage license. For example, a biometric 
                template could be embedded in the birth certificate claim and that template could be 
                used for interactive identity assurance at the time of submitting the presentation.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Threat: Exposure of private information.</strong>  By storing potentially 
              compromising information in credentials and sending them over the network, we are 
              increasing the attack surface for the subjects of those credentials. </li>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Response:</strong> Encrypt the claims (once by issuer, every verifier gets 
                the same encrypted blob)</li>
              <li><strong>Response:</strong> Encrypt the claims uniquely for each verifier. This may 
                leak usage data to the issuer, assuming the Holder must ask for a new, encrypted 
                credential for each Verifier.</li>
              <li><strong>Response:</strong> Blind the claims uniquely for each verifier.</li>
              <li><strong>Response:</strong> Encrypt the presentation uniquely for each verifier. No

      <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Malathi is traveling internationally with her 8-month old son, Anand. His father Rajesh is staying home. 
          She books the plane tickets through her travel agent who adds the lap child to the ticket. Malathi 
          obtains permission from Rajesh stating she is allowed to take the baby out of the country. Malathi has 
          enough frequent flyer miles to upgrade the ticket to first class.</p>
      <h3>Distinction</h3>
        <p>Credentials must be coordinated between two verifiers (agent and airline) for two individuals, and a 
          digital coupon is used.</p>
        <p>Permission for one parent to fly with the child and without the other parent must be established.</p>
      <h3>Scenario</h3>
        <p>HappyAir must verify that Malathi is Anand’s guardian and that she is legally allowed to exit the country
          with him and without his other parent.</p>
        <p>Prior to booking the trips Malathi visits HappyAir.com to requests an upgrade to first class. HappyAir 
          issues a Verifiable Credential redeemable for a first class upgrade on an international flight.</p>
      <h3>Verifiable Credentials</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Traveling Parent passport</li>
          <li>Minor passport (implies parentage/guardianship = “responsibility”?). Note that the subject != holder. The holder(s) of the passport are parents, not the baby.</li>
          <li>Permission from non-traveling parent </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Parents are the holders of the passport credential</li>
            <li>Parents must present the passport credential</li>
            <li>In order for one parent to present the passport credential alone, they must give mutual permission.</li>
            <li>This replaces the role of a notarized permission document</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Coupon for upgrade (interchangeable for $$)</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Verifiable Presentation</h3>
        <p>Submitted to HappyAir, includes assertion of permission and Frequent Flyer coupon. </p>
      <h3>Trust Hierarchy</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Malathi is liable for her claim of parentage as well as securing right to admission for herself and her son at their destination (visa may be required). </li>
          <li>Malathi and Rajesh are both liable for attestation of permission to fly with Anand without the other parent. </li>
          <li>Malathi is liable for the cost of her ticket and her son’s ticket. </li>
          <li>The agency is liable for issuing valid tickets and for verifying the credentials provided by the travelers. </li>
          <li>The airline is liable for issuing tickets and, ultimately, fulfilling the terms of travel [does the airline issue tickets or do the agents?]. </li>
          <li>The airline is liable for accepting the upgrade coupons at ticketing. </li>
          <li>The check-in agent, TSA agent, and passport control at the destination are liable for identity assurance at various points of travel, using information contained in the verifiable credentials.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Threat model</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Threat: Key compromise.</strong> Either parent’s keys could be in the hands of a bad actor,

    they are meant to help illustrate the basic way it <em>could</em> be done in a
    typical commerce situation.
    Again - please remember that it is just an
    example, and should not be thought of as the canonical way such
    a claims environment must be implemented.</p>
    <section>
        <h2>How a verifiable claim might be created</h2>
        <p>In this first example, a user will request a Verifiable Claim - a
        confirmation of their identity. Consider this illustration:</p>

        <img aria-describedby="claim_flow" alt='Verifiable Claim Creation Flow Description' style='display:block; margin:auto' src="uc-issuing-claims.svg"/>
        <p>Expanding on these steps:</p>
        <ol id="claim_flow" title="Verifiable Claim Creation Flow Description">
            <li>Jane asks her User Agent to help her get a Verifiable Claim about
            her identity.</li>
            <li>Her user agent connects her to a certificate issuer that is able
            to verify her identity.</li>
            <li>The issuer examines her documentation.</li>
            <li>They are satisfied, so the issuer generates a Verifiable Claim for
            Jane that includes information about her identity linked to their
            own trusted <em>credential</em>.</li>
            <li>The issuer delivers the credential back to Jane's User Agent.</li>
            <li>Jane views the credential to ensure it reflects her
            requirements.</li>
            <li>When she is satisfied, she instructs her User Agent to save the
            Verifiable Claim so she can use it in the future.</li>
            <li>The UA communicates with her <a>Credential Repository</a>,
            instructing it to store the new claim.</li>
            <li>The <a>Credential Repository</a> returns a list of the claims it is
            holding for Jane to the UA.</li>
            <li>The UA shows Jane her claim collection - confirming
            everything she has available.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>How a verifiable claim might be used</h2>
        <p>In this example, a <a>holder</a> of a claim needs to use that claim in a
        typical commerce situation:</p>
        <img aria-describedby="vf-flow" alt='Verifiable Claim Usage Flow Diagram' style='display:block; margin:auto' src="example.svg"/>
        <ol title="Verifiable Claim Usage Flow Description" id="vf-flow">
            <li>Jane decides to shop on the web site
            WinesOfTheWorld.example.com (merchant).</li>
            <li>The merchant's site requires Jane be 21 years of age and
            requests Jane prove this (via a user agent-supported API call).</li>
            <li>Jane's user agent asks her <a>credential repository</a> for the
            proof.</li>
            <li>The <a>credential repository</a> shows Jane three Verifiable Claims
            it knows of that
            can assert this claim (e.g., her passport, driving
            license, and birth certificate).</li>
            <li>Jane selects one of these and authorizes that it be
            shared with the merchant.</li>
            <li>The <a>credential repository</a> returns the selected claim as a response
            to the user agent-supported API call, which in turn delivers
            it to the merchant.</li>
            <li>The merchant's server verifies that the claim is valid
            and satisfies the requirement.</li>
            <li>The merchant redirects the user agent to the web site
            with appropriate authorization.</li>
        </ol>
